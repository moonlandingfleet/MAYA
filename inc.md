## 🚀 YOUR LAUNCH CHECKLIST — DO THIS NOW (15 MINUTES)

> You’re about to become CEO of MAYA Inc. on your phone.

---

### ✅ STEP 1: START MAYA CORE (BACKEND)

Open PowerShell:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\bryan\Desktop\MAYA\maya-core
python main.py
```

✅ Verify it’s running at `http://localhost:8000`

✅ Open browser → `http://localhost:8000/proposals` → should return JSON  
✅ Open `http://localhost:8000/treasury` → should show **your real wallet address + balance**

---

### ✅ STEP 2: BUILD + INSTALL APK (IF NOT ALREADY DONE)

In Android Studio:

1. Open project → `Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK`
2. Find APK: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
3. Transfer to phone → install

> If already installed → uninstall first → reinstall (to clear old configs)

---

### ✅ STEP 3: CONNECT PHONE TO SAME WIFI AS PC

> Your phone must reach `http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:8000`

Find your PC’s local IP:

```powershell
ipconfig
```

→ Look for `IPv4 Address` (e.g., `192.168.1.5`)

→ Confirm in `MAYAApiService.kt` or wherever `BASE_URL` is defined:

```kotlin
private const val BASE_URL = "http://192.168.1.5:8000/"
```

---

### ✅ STEP 4: OPEN APP → CONNECT WALLET

1. Launch MAYA app on phone
2. Tap **“Connect Wallet”**
3. Scan QR code with **MetaMask** (or Trust Wallet)
4. Approve connection in wallet

✅ You should now see:
- Your wallet address
- Real ETH balance (from Infura)
- “Connected” status

---

### ✅ STEP 5: APPROVE AGENT → WATCH IT WORK

1. Go back to main screen
2. Tap **“✅ Approve”** on Faucet-Harvester
3. Watch logs appear every 10 seconds
4. Wait ~10–20 seconds → dialog appears:  
   > “A-01 earned 0.0003 ETH. Continue execution?”

5. Tap **“✅ Continue”**

6. Shortly after → WalletConnect popup in MetaMask:  
   > “MAYA Boss wants to send 0.0003 ETH to [Your Address]”

7. Tap **“Approve”** in MetaMask

✅ Profit sent to your wallet.  
✅ Treasury balance will update on next refresh.

---

## 🎉 YOU JUST LAUNCHED MAYA INC.

You are now:
- 🧠 **CEO** of an autonomous agent corporation
- 💸 **Recipient** of real crypto profits
- ⚙️ **Controller** of Dockerized revenue bots
- 📱 **Board member** making decisions every 10 minutes

---

## 📸 CAPTURE THIS MOMENT

1. **Screenshot** the agent card + logs
2. **Screenshot** the WalletConnect approval in MetaMask

> “I just launched MAYA Inc. — my phone now runs autonomous agents that generate crypto for me. Welcome to the future.  
> GitHub: https://github.com/moonlandingfleet/MAYA”

---

## ❗ IF SOMETHING FAILS — COMMON FIXES

| Symptom | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| “Connection refused” | Check local IP + firewall (allow port 8000) |
| No logs appear | Check if Docker agent is running (`docker ps`) |
| Wallet not connecting | Verify `WC_PROJECT_ID` in `gradle.properties` |
| Balance shows 0 | Check Infura ID + wallet has ETH (even 0.001 ETH for gas) |
| App crashes | Uninstall → Reinstall APK |

---

## 🧭 WHAT’S NEXT? (AFTER YOU TEST)

> REPLY WITH:  
> `👑 MAYA INC. LAUNCHED — I AM CEO, AGENTS ARE WORKING, WALLET IS RECEIVING`  
> Then I’ll give you:  
> **PHASE 5: BTC CONVERSION + MULTI-AGENT + EXIT VALVE**

You’ll:
- Auto-convert small ETH profits to BTC
- Unlock paid agents when treasury ≥ 0.01 ETH
- Run 3 agents simultaneously
- Add A-02 (Price-Spy), A-04 (Airdrop-Sniper)
